# Culture Fit
The shit you gotta do to get paid is wild, but it’s a living. 

## Background
Office politics hell simulator, where you have to maintain ‘culture fit’ to stay employed and climb the ranks. 
This can be thought of as Sorry To Bother You: The Game, in a sense. 
Code-switch, drop jargon, and avoid the various traps and gatekeeping laid out before you. 
Concepts: cultural chameleonism through code-switching, cultural signifiers, gatekeeping, purity tests, social pressure, mental stress.

## Gameplay
Players face off in a conversation and attempt to get the upper hand by deploying every stupid, sociopathic, evo-pysch horseshit, PUA-style ‘power move’ available to them. A parody of the endless litany of corporate training courses that appear to be written by alien lizard people with a poisonous outlook on social interaction.

- First phase: Handshake and eye contact, rock paper scissors with unhinged plays and results
- Second phase: Business cards, build a business card to attack the enemy, while mentally defending from their own attack
- Third phase: Small talk, like insult swordfighting, maybe a bit of Mad Libs. Brag, insult, blather.
