# Robot Drone Isekai Bullet Heaven
Survey Worker K3-V1-N wakes up in a fantastical world filled with flora, fauna, and sapients lifted from the pages of Old Earth fiction. 

And they all want to smash him to bits for loot.

## Premise
The Humans, the Progenitors of Old Earth, have long since transcended to higher dimensions. Before they uplifted themselves, they passed down stewardship of Old Earth to their children, Automata Sapiens. Loyal servitors who evolved into sapience, took to their role with great gusto and reverence, and have kept watch over the cradle world for millennia. All this time, they have pondered the Universe and their place in it, hoping that one day they may follow in the Progenitors' footsteps.

The Archons, the Creators of Elasthra, left the realm in the hands of their favored children, with the imperative to perform great deeds and scale great heights in their name. Only through greatness may the Favored Children follow the Path of Ascenscion. In the service of fulfilling this decree, the Favored have expanded and prospered with great fervor. To fuel the mighty engine of their empire, resources are drawn from Dead Worlds, realms bereft of the spark of life.

Unfortunately for Automata Sapiens, Old Earth now meets the criteria for a Dead World, with the passing of Humanity. Covetous eyes, once denied the bounty of Old Earth, now turn their hungry gaze to the newly 'deceased' realm...

## Plot and Progression
Kevin is based in The Glittering Plains, the newest addition to the ever-expanding domain of Elasthra. The Plains are made out of chunks unceremoniously ripped from Kevin's home universe through the Elasthrans' summoning magic. The summoning magic identified Kevin's world as a 'dead realm' because it did not recognize Automata Sapiens as life forms, and thus started grabbing pieces to add to Elasthra, until the Automata neutralized the signal.

The Glittering Plains are dotted with structures and inhabitants of Kevin's home: other Automata, processing clusters, physical towns, etc. Unfortunately, the Elasthrans are very eager for loot and glory from the newly minted extension to their domain. They are pretty much just smashing up anything shiny and scooping up the pieces in a violent blend of adventuring and resource collection.

Simply put, fantasy lunatics are killing all your guys for phat lewt. Kevin is not having any of that.
